SabreCE
=======

For controlling a Sabre DAC with the CE644 development board v1.3 in combination with a Newhaven character OLED not for sale!). The user interface and DAC can be controlled with any Apple remote, 5 push buttons or using both at the same time :)

This repository contains:
  - A Sabre library for controling a ES9018 DAC from ESS.
  - A GUI library for displaying DAC settings, using a character OLED.
      (This library is developed to be used with the Sabre library)
  - A modified version of Ken shirrif's IR remote library.
  - A modified version of Elco Jacob's OLEDfourbit library for interfacing a Newhaven OLED display (Rev.A). (Remove this         library when using a Rev.C display)
  - A modified version of Adafruit's characterOLED library for interfacing a Newhaven OLED display (Rev.C).(Remove this          library when using a Rev.A display)
  - A DS1307 library for interfacing the DS1307 RTC.
  - A modified version of EEPROMWriteAnything

Still under development!

  
In theory the code can also be used with Arduino Mega or similar development boards, but not without changing some parts of the code.
