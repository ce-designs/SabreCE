SabreCE
=======

For controlling a Sabre DAC with the CE644 v1.3 development board in combination with a Newhaven character OLED display. (not for sale!)

This repository contains:
  - A Sabre library for controling a ES9018 DAC from ESS.
  - A GUI library for displaying DAC settings, using a character OLED.
      (This library is developed to be used with the Sabre library)
  - A modified version of Ken shirrif's IR remote library.
  - A modified version of Elco Jacob's OLEDfourbit library for interfacing a Newhaven OLED display (Rev.A).
  - A modified version of Adafruit's characterOLED library for interfacing a Newhaven OLED display (Rev.C).\
 
To be added:
  - A DS1307 library for interfacing the DS1307 RTC.
  - A encoder library for infacing a rotary encoder.
  - 


  
In theory the code can also be used with Arduino Mega or similar development boards, but not without changing some parts of the code.
